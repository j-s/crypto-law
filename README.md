# Horyzon Law
Exploring cryptoequities, app coins and ICOs in the context of Australian securities law

## Revised project outline:

1. Intro to the decentralised auto. organisation - types of crypto-tokens/assets/app-coins that exist.

2. Their status under Aus securities law.  (Regulators globally will take the position that an electronic offer is made in all jurisdictions unless eligibility is made clear via disclaimers and barriers to access… therefore Aus securities law could be “applied" if they fit the definition).

3. Liability and accountability - who might be liable and on what grounds?  (Fiduciary obligations? Trust relationships? Negligence?  Securities law?… promoters, coders, curators, no-one??…)

4. Enforceability - what I see as the large and neglected issue.  Even if you can identify a liable party… how do you bring an action!?  Good luck.

5. Does a hybrid model exist?  What new class of security can we create that utilises the advantages of app-coins and crowdsales.  How would they fit within existing securities regulation —> (potentially) draft up a mini white-paper or proposal.
